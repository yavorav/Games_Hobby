How do you make this interactive? to do back and forth with input and function running??
I think I need a different interpreter to run that maybe, cuz this one seems to take all
inputs at once no matter how many input() lines I have.

So far it's also only the player being hit. should there be monsters to attack? and then
you have to choose which monster to fight first, it drops loot (heal potions).
Random probability of hitting?
    >> get a better weapon with better probability of hitting?
    >> need an inventory to hold potions, and count how many you have left

    >> turn based combat
    >> enemy will always attack on its turn
    >> you basically have a choice of attack, heal, run
        >> run option will give you "well you didn't die but I guess you're a coward" lol
    
    >> if attack hits are random, can we win? what HP do you and the monster need for 
    the combat to work?
    >> what if it's always a hit but how much damage is what varies? Then mathimatically
    you can make it so you'll always win if damage is always 1, and so you'll probably win
    early

    >> should also define an 'info' function, to remind you of your options and tell
    you what's in your inventory. For quality of life

add cheat code...? which will level you up to 3 automatically?
    >> add method to player class, cheat = False, then once they cheat it changes to True and they can't use it again
    >> define random string in data
    >> additional check in 'main menu', if text == cheat_code
        >> "you've cheated and leveled up to level 3 without fighting monsters... are you really an adventurer?"
